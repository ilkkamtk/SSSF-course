# NoSQL

* NoSQL = "non SQL", "non relational" or "not only SQL"
* Contains about anything that is not only relational databases
  * Document databases like MongoDB
  * Key-value storages like Redis
  * Graph databases like OrientDB and Neo4j
  * Object databases like ObjectDB
  * Tabular databases like Hbase and BigTable

---

# MongoDB

* [Free & open source](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) document-oriented database
  * First released in February 2009
  * Currently v3.x
* [Install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
* [Shell access](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/getting-started-with-the-mongo-shell/) (eventually, some UI like [Robomongo](https://robomongo.org/))
* [Enable authentication](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/enable-authentication/)

# Main features

* Ad hoc queries
* Indexing
* High availability (replication)
* Supports sharding (scaling horizontally)
* File storage
* JavaScript execution
* Aggregation with map-reduce

---

# Basic structure

* Server has multiple databases
* Database has multiple collections
  * Like tables in relational database
  * Usually contains many related documents
  * Do not enforce schema on documents
  * Starting from 3.2 validations available for documents (checked on inserts and updates)
* Collection has multiple documents (rows)
  * JSON-like structure for collection of key-value pairs
  * Serialized and stored as BSON (Binary JSON)
* Document has multiple fields (columns)
  * Can have different fields from each other within the collection
  * Collection-wide unique identifier (12-byte, stored usually in _id field) can be manually set for document. If not set, one is generated

---

# Modeling data 

* Modeling the data is different from relational databases
  * Storage is cheap compared to computing time 
  * Duplicating data is acceptable
* Model data by user requirements
* Joins on write, not on read
* Optimize for most usual use case
* Example: Blog post documents stores tags (strings) and comments (objects with text, author etc.) within the blog document itself (with author, text, date, etc.)
