# Promise

* A `Promise` object is use for asynchronous task
* A `Promise` represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never
* When creating a Promise, a function is given as parameter that will be called imediately
  * that function takes `resolve` and `reject` parameters
  * once that function completes, either calls the `resolve` function to resolve the promise or `rejects` it if an error occurred
  * If an exception is thrown in the function, the promise is rejected (the return value of the function is ignored)

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  /* ...usually some asynchronous task... */
  //on succes...
  resolve('Yes :)');
  //on failure...
  reject('NO NO NO!');
}
```

---

# Promise then() and catch()

* A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error)
  * When any of these happen, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's `then` method are called
  * the Promise `then()` and `catch()` methods return promises so they can be chained

# Promise then() 

* The Promise `then` method take one or two parameters
  * A function called when the Promise is fulfilled. This function has one argument, the fulfillment value
  * Optionally a function called when the Promise is rejected. This function has one argument, the rejection reason

```javascript
myPromise.then((successMsg) => {
  console.log('Really: ' + successMsg);
}, (errorMsg) => {
  console.log('So sad :( ' + errorMsg);
});
```
---

# Promise catch()

* The `catch` method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only, so takes only one parameter function

```javascript
myPromise.then((successMsg) => {
  console.log('Really: ' + successMsg);
  //but something bad...
  throw 'oh, no :(';
}).catch((e) => {
  console.log(e); 
}).then(() => {
  console.log('after a catch the chain is restored');
});
```
